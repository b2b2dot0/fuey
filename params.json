{"name":"Fuey","tagline":"Troubleshoot your server connections with ease! Automate with Fuey.","body":"### Why we built Fuey?\r\n[We](www.b2b2dot0.com) believe in ensuring our customers instances are able to reach their required\r\nnetwork resources. Because when required resources become unavailable, \r\nwe want to know first! We also want to know where a connection failed. \r\nDid the VPN drop? Was their SAP instance down? Or did the internets blowup? \r\nWhatever the answer is we want to know it and know it with little effort.\r\n\r\n### How does Fuey do it?\r\nWe like, well love, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) at [B2b2dot0](www.b2b2dot0.com) so we wrote a \r\n[Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/fuey_client) called [FueyClient](https://github.com/b2b2dot0/fuey_client) \r\nthat resides on each server we want to keep an eye on. Because we believe in simplicity, configuring FueyClient \r\ncan be done with [a simple YAML file](https://github.com/b2b2dot0/fuey_client/blob/master/config_example/fuey/config/fuey.yml).\r\nThen just run the FueyClient every minute, 5 minutes, etc with Cron or your favorite scheduler. \r\n\r\nWhen the client runs it executes each `Trace` and  it's `Inspections`. As it does so it provides real time updates \r\nto the Fuey via [Redis](www.redis.io). The web Fuey web app then subscribes to the Redis queue and uses \r\n[Rails Live Streaming](http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/07/30/is-it-live.html) and \r\n[Server Sent Events](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/)\r\nto push updates to connected browsers resulting in a constant feed of real time trace results!\r\n\r\n### What does Fuey look like?\r\nIt looks like awesome! The dashboard shows you the number of currently reporting `Traces`, allows you to filter those \r\n`Traces` by status, name, and/or environment. Keep whichever filters you like applied and show Fuey on a monitor in \r\nyour workspace, it will update on it's own!\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nRuby 2.0 (For Fuey Web App)\r\nRuby 1.8.7, 1.9, or 2.0 (For FueyClient)\r\nRedis 2.6\r\nRails 4\r\nPuma\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nInstall FueyClient on each server you would like to monitor.\r\nTo setup the FeuyClient, refer to the [README](https://github.com/b2b2dot0/fuey_client/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\nInstall and setup Redis. Configure the FueyClient's to use this Redis server.\r\n\r\nInstall the Fuey Web App.\r\nClone the Fuey repo where you'd like to have it reside on your webserver\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:b2b2dot0/fuey.git\r\n```\r\nMake sure you have bundler installed\r\n```\r\ngem install bundler\r\n```\r\nChange directory into the Fuey app, and run\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\nFire up the app with Puma\r\n```\r\nrails s puma\r\n```\r\nOnce your Fuey Clients start reporting, you will see them appear in the Fuey web app dashboard. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
